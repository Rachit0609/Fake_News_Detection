# Fake News Detection Using Semantic Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles by analyzing their semantic content through natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It includes preprocessing of text data, exploratory analysis using word clouds and n-grams, and classification models to distinguish true news from fake news with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, stop word removal, and lemmatization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (word clouds and n-grams)
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score metrics
- Random Forest model achieved highest performance (~99.8% accuracy)

## Installation
Clone the repository:


## Usage
Run the main notebook or script to perform:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis and plotting
- Model training and evaluation

You can modify the code to experiment with other models or datasets.

## Results
The Random Forest classifier achieved the best results with Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-Score close to 99.8%, making it an effective approach for fake news detection.
